# How to Add Images to Your 75 @ 50 Newsletter

## Quick Start

Your newsletter is ready! You just need to add the images from your PDF.

## Step 1: Extract Images from PDF

### Option A: Online Tool (Easiest)
1. Go to https://www.ilovepdf.com/pdf_to_jpg
2. Upload "St Edmunds School and the March of Time.pdf"
3. Download all images

### Option B: Screenshot Method
1. Open the PDF
2. Take a screenshot of each image
3. Save with the names listed below

### Option C: Adobe Reader
1. Open PDF in Adobe Reader
2. Right-click each image → "Save Image As..."

## Step 2: Rename Your Images

Rename the extracted images to match these exact filenames:

- `driveway-then-now.jpg` - The School Driveway photo
- `school-building-1954.jpg` - School Building 1954-1973
- `school-building-pre1954.jpg` - Pre-1954 School Building
- `school-building-1975.jpg` - School Building in 1975
- `summer-house.jpg` - Summer House Then & Now
- `first-field.jpg` - School First Field
- `swimming-pool.jpg` - Swimming Pool
- `pavilion.jpg` - The Pavilion
- `chapel.jpg` - The Chapel
- `school-hall.jpg` - School Hall
- `stone-building.jpg` - Stone Building
- `handball-court.jpg` - Handball Court
- `boarding-extension.jpg` - Boarding Section Extension
- `providence-school.jpg` - Providence School

## Step 3: Organize Your Files

Create this folder structure:

```
75-at-50-newsletter/
├── 75-at-50-newsletter.html
├── images/
│   ├── driveway-then-now.jpg
│   ├── school-building-1954.jpg
│   ├── school-building-pre1954.jpg
│   ├── school-building-1975.jpg
│   ├── summer-house.jpg
│   ├── first-field.jpg
│   ├── swimming-pool.jpg
│   ├── pavilion.jpg
│   ├── chapel.jpg
│   ├── school-hall.jpg
│   ├── stone-building.jpg
│   ├── handball-court.jpg
│   ├── boarding-extension.jpg
│   └── providence-school.jpg
└── README.md (this file)
```

## Step 4: Test Locally

1. Open `75-at-50-newsletter.html` in your web browser
2. All images should now appear!

## Step 5: Upload to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload all files (the HTML file AND the images folder)
3. Enable GitHub Pages in Settings
4. Your newsletter will be live!

## Tips

- **Image Format**: JPG or PNG both work fine
- **Image Size**: The newsletter will automatically resize images, but try to keep them under 2MB each for faster loading
- **Quality**: Higher quality images will look better, especially for the "Then & Now" comparisons

## Need Help?

If images don't show up:
1. Make sure the image filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Make sure images are in the `images/` folder
3. Check that the folder structure is correct
4. Try opening the HTML file in a different browser
